# Lab 03. Classes

## Enum - Months

- Create an enum called `Month` with the name of each month as the values
  - Run `[Month]3` in PowerShell, what do you get as output? Why?

---

## Class - Guessing Game

- Create the class `Game`
  - Properties
    - `[int] $GuessCount`
    - `hidden [int] $Target`
  - Constructor
    - The constructor should set `$Target` to a random number between 1 and 100
    - Set `$GuessCount` to 0
  - Method
    - There should be one method called `Guess` which takes a number as a parameter. The method should increase `$GuessCount` by one, compare the entered number to the property `$Target` and return strings according to the following:
      - Lower than `$Target` - 'The guess was too low, try again!'
      - Higher than `$Target` - 'The guess was too high, try again!'
      - Same as `$Target` - 'You won in `$GuessCount` guesses!'

- *Optional:*
  - Create an enum called `GameState` with two values
    - InProgress
    - Completed
  - Add the property `[GameState] $State` to the `Game` class
    - Set `$State` to `[GameState]::InProgress` in the constructor
    - Set `$State` to `[GameState]::Completed` when the user guesses correctly
  - Make the `Guess` method return another message if the game has already been completed
